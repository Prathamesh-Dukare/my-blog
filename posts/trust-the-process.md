I still remember an incident from first year of college when my professor called me on stage to speaküó£. Up until that point, I had never spoken on stage before. At the time, At first, I was hesitant and angry when my professor asked me to speak on stage. 

However, later on, I realized that my fear of addressing a group of people had been reduced. It made me realize that I could speak, and it helped me become a better version of myself.

Similarly, we see AI as a threat to our jobs, businesses, and so on. It's true that times are tough, and surviving a job has never been this challenging. AI has challenged the abilities we've developed over the years overnight, which means we need to put in ten times more work now.

But trust the process; this is ultimately for the great cause. It's time for humanity to solve bigger problems, and we have to rise to the challenge. 

After all, God has a plan ‚ù§.
